The goal of this repository is to vibe code a small interactive web application
showing the lines and points involved in a geometry problem. The problem in
question is Q5 from the 2015/16 British Mathematical Olympiad, Round 1, and is
[available](https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmo1-2016.pdf) on the BMO website.
The app does not give a solution to the problem; it merely provides visual
evidence of the truth of the problem statement.

To view the app, go to https://mdickinson.github.io/triangleapp

The app was coded entirely by Claude Sonnet 4.5 using Agent mode in VS Code.
