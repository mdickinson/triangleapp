The goal of this repository is to vibe code a small interactive web application
showing the lines and points involved in a school geometry problem.

Problem:

Let ABC be a triangle, and let D, E and F be the feet of the perpendiculars
from A, B and C to BC, CA and AB respectively. Let P, Q, R and S be the feet
of the perpendiculars from D to BA, BE, CF and CA respectively. Prove that
the points P, Q, R and S are collinear.

We want the app to show the points A, B and C and allow the user to move
them around. The app should then dynamically compute and display the points
D, E, F, P, Q, R and S as well as the line containing P, Q, R and S. The app
should also show the various line segments.

Initial prompt:

Create an interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that
shows three points A, B and C on a canvas, along with the line segments
AB, BC and CA forming a triangle ABC. The application should allow the user
to move the points A, B and C by dragging them with the mouse, and the line
segments should update dynamically as the points are moved.
